Problem Statement: Analyze the monthly seasonally adjusted unemployment rates for the given employment data of the U.S. “unemp.csv” file,
covering the period January 1976 through August 2010 for the 50 U.S. states(n = 50). 

The requirement is to cluster the states into groups that are alike. Here, each state is characterized by a feature vector of a very 
large dimension (p = 416). Its components represent 416 monthly observations.
